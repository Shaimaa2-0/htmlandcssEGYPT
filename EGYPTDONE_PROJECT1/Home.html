        <p> The Nile River flows over 6,600 kilometers (4,100 miles) until emptying into the Mediterranean Sea. 


            For thousands of years, the river has provided a source of irrigation to transform the dry area around it into lush agricultural land.
            
            
            Today, the river continues to serve as a source of irrigation, as well as an important transportation and trade route.

        <h2>Saqqara</h2>
        <img  class="img1" src="https://www.arce.org/sites/default/files/2019-02/Pyramid%20complex%20Djoser_Saqqara_IA.jpg">

        <p>Saqqara, the sweeping necropolis and pyramid field of Memphis, the first Capital of Egypt, has been an important historical site for 5,000 years of Egyptian history. 

            This large area about 20 miles south of Cairo features the small square tombs of the kings of the first and second dynasties Most famously, the first king of the third dynasty, Djoser, asked his vizier and chief architect to erect for him the first monument built entirely of stone in ancient Egypt. 
            
            The result is the famous step pyramid of Saqqara and its surrounding funerary complex.

        <h2>Siwa Oasis</h2>
        <img  class="img1" src="https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/features/2014/07/nile-cruise-egypt-63c7bab066af.jpg">

        <p>Located approximately 350 miles from Cairo, east of the Libyan border, Siwa Oasis is one of Egypt’s best western desert oases with its thousands of palm trees and gorgeous hot springs.
 

            Until the 1980’s when a highway was finally completed connecting it to the coastal town of Mersa Mahruh, it was completely isolated from the rest of the country. 
            
            There is an increasing number of hotels ranging from budget hostels to a 5-star eco-lodge in the oasis and the tourist trade is now firmly rooted as part of the local economy.
